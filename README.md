1. Information security covers a wide range of topics. Information security protects data and information from unauthorized access, unlawful modification and disruption, disclosure, corruption, and destruction.
2. Security Administration is responsible for installing, administering and troubleshooting an organization's security solutions. Security administrators also write security policies and training documents about security procedures for colleagues. Other responsibilities include monitoring network traffic for suspicious activity, scanning and accessing networks for vulnerability, and developing and updating business continuity and disaster recovery protocols.
3. Authentication is the act of verifying a user is who they say they are. Verifying the user helps protect against unauthorized access from a system. Authentication can be broken down into five categories. Three of those categories are something the user knows, this can be a password or a pin only the user should theoretically know this. The next category is something the user has such as a smart card, or a swipe id, and an example of this is entering at Baruch campus where students must swipe their student ID to gain access to the building. The next category is something the user is, this can be fingerprint which gives us access to our iPhone, or retina scan. This is only three out of the five categories that authentication can be broken down into.
4. Blue hat hackers can be used to hack into a computer system before it goes live. Blue hat hackers can test the system for bugs, and look for exploits so they can be patched before it goes live.
