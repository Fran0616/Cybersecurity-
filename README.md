A quick guide into cybersecurity 



Introduction to Information Security

1. Information security covers a wide range of topics. Information security protects data and information from unauthorized access, unlawful modification and disruption, disclosure, corruption, and destruction.
2. Security Administration is responsible for installing, administering and troubleshooting an organization's security solutions. Security administrators also write security policies and training documents about security procedures for colleagues. Other responsibilities include monitoring network traffic for suspicious activity, scanning and accessing networks for vulnerability, and developing and updating business continuity and disaster recovery protocols.
3. Authentication is the act of verifying a user is who they say they are. Verifying the user helps protect against unauthorized access from a system. Authentication can be broken down into five categories. Three of those categories are something the user knows, this can be a password or a pin only the user should theoretically know this. The next category is something the user has such as a smart card, or a swipe id, and an example of this is entering at Baruch campus where students must swipe their student ID to gain access to the building. The next category is something the user is, this can be fingerprint which gives us access to our iPhone, or retina scan. This is only three out of the five categories that authentication can be broken down into.
4. Blue hat hackers can be used to hack into a computer system before it goes live. Blue hat hackers can test the system for bugs, and look for exploits so they can be patched before it goes live.

1. A ​virus​ is malicious code that runs on a user's computer without their knowledge. Once executed the code replicates itself by modifying other computer programs and infect the system with its own code.
2. Viruses include ​Boot Sector​, this virus hides in a file on a USB drive or email attachment. Once executed the virus infect the system’s master boot record to damage the system. Another type of virus is ​macro​, this type of virus is written in macro language embedded inside applications like Excel spreadsheet. This is part of the reason why it’s dangerous to open unknown email attachments. ​Polymorphic​ viruses encrypt their codes and use different encryption keys every time in order to vary their physical file makeup. This characteristic makes them really complex because of how it can create modified versions of itself. These are only three of the many types of virus out there in the cyber world.
3. Ransomware​ is a type of malware that restricts access to a computer system and demons that a ransom be paid. The malicious program encrypts personal files. The malware then informs the user to make a payment in order to decrypt the file, payment would have to be made in one or several banking services, often oversea. CryptoLocker is an example of a ransomware that encrypts certain files on the computer’s drives using a public key.
4. Virus can be delivered in multiple avenues. Three ways it is delivered is via backdoors, logic bombs, and software, messaging and media.
5. As the name suggests ​Intrusion Detection System (IDS) ​is a system that detects and identifies an incident and attacks. An IDS monitors an individual computer system or a network, or simply a portion of a network to identify threats.
6. Content filter is a software that blocks external files that use JavaScript to image from loading into the browser.
7. BIOS (Basic Input/ Output System) is the program a computer microprocessor uses to start the computer system after it’s started. The BIOS like any other part of a computer can become infected. Two ways to secure the BIOS is using a BIOS password which will help prevent unauthorized access to the system. And disabling any external ports and devices will prevent malicious code from infecting the system via USB.
8. DLP (Data Loss Prevention) can be software or hardware based. Endpoint DLP systems run on individual computers and are usually software based. They monitor data in use, such as email communications, and can control what type of information flows between users.

1. In order to help keep a computer well maintained and secure, users should first use a surge protector or UPS. Second the BIOS and/or UEFI should be updated periodically. The third step consists of updating the OS. Fourth thing that should be done is updating the anti malware programs, following this the fifth step the firewall should be updated. Six steps on the list is to maintain the disk, and finally this is optional but users can create an image of the system.
2. A hypervisor is also known as a Virtual Machine, allowing multiple operating systems to run at the same time on a single computer. There are two types of hypervisors, type 1 is the native and type 2 is hosted. Native hypervisor runs directly on the host computer’s hardware. Examples of this include VMware vCenter and VSphere. Type two hosted hypervisor runs within the operating systems. Guest operating systems run within the hypervisor. Some examples of hosted hypervisors are VirtualBox, Windows Virtual PC, Hyper-V, and VMware workstation.
3. To minimize OS exposure to threats and to mitigate risk, a system administrator might harden a OS. Hardening OS can be accomplished by configuring the OS security, updating it, creating rules and policies to help govern the system in a secure manner, and removing unnecessary applications and services.
4. Cookies are text files placed on a client computer that stores information about it. These text files might keep information about browsing habits and user credentials. Cookies can be used for authentication, keeping track of online shopping carrots, and users sessions. Tracking cookies are specialized and they can be shared by more than one website or service, and can be used for marketing and advertising. They can also be used as a way to exploit users by tracking their online behavior. Session cookies store temporary information and are deleted once the session is completed or the web browser is closed.
